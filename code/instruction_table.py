This file contains the data structure used to represent the instruction table and every entry in it.

Each entry is a data structure that stores the cycle in which the instruction passed through different
stages of the pipeline. It is used to keep track of the state of execution of the instruction, along
with the final outcome(result) of the instruction. This result is ideally supposed to come from a FPU,
but I am cheating here. The result is calculated by the reservation station.

This is by far the most important class, in terms of maintaining execution order
